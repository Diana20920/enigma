# Self-assessment
#### Functionality
  - *Meets expectations.*
#### OOP
  - *Between below and meets expectations.* I have some ideas on what I would like to move out/into classes.
#### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
  - *Meets expectations.* I can do a better job at naming variables, especially when used between classes.
#### TDD
  - *Meets expectations.*
#### Version Control
  - I started off well with branching, but as I became confused and stressed I made the decision to lower the priority of branches workflow and focus on writing functional code. I aim to be able to do both naturally and fluidly.
